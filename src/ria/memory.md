# RIA Memory Map

The whole last page of bank 0 (`$00FF00` - `$00FFFF`) is dedicated to internal I/O devices.

"Area $00FE00-$00FEFF is used to handle extension devices. Divided into 8x 32byte chunks.
If you _really_ need to use RAM in this area, use `$00FFF6` register to map RAM chunks in."

Following is the memory mapping of registers of hardware interfaced by RIA.

## RIA - Raspberry Interface Adapter

## CGIA - Color Graphic Interface Adaptor

And most of [Atari ANTIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANTIC#Registers) registers will go hereâ€¦
